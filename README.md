Given the HTML in index.html, make the following changes with javascript â€“ don't change the index.html file!

- Any time someone clicks on the heading at the top "feed template,"
  make the color of the "feed template" text change from black to red
  and then from red to black when clicked again.
- Hide every other link in the left column so that only "Your Name", "Section 2", "Section 4", and "Section 6" are on the page.
- Change every instance of the word "bacon" (and "Bacon") on the page to "LASER VISION".
- Remove the last two posts in the middle section (they have a CSS class "post").
- Remove the images in the right column. Do not remove the paragraph tags within which these image tags are nested.
- Before submitting this assessment, be sure to test each change again to make sure all changes are present and functioning as expected.

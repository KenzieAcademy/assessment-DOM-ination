Given the HTML in index.html, make the following changes with javascript â€“ don't change the index.html file!

- Any time someone clicks on the title at the top "feed template,"
  make the color of the "feed template" text change from black to red
  and then from red to black when clicked again.
- Hide every other link in the left column so that only "Your Name", "Section 2", "Section 4", and "Section 6" are on the page.
- Change every instance of the word "bacon" on the page to be "LASER VISION"
- Delete the last two posts in the middle section (they have a CSS class "post")

Given the HTML in index.html, make the following changes with javascript – don't change the index.html file!

- Any time someone clicks on the title at the top "feed template,"
  make the color of the "feed template" text change from black to red
  and then from red to black when clicked again.
- The links on the side of the page – "your name," "section 1," "section 2," etc. –
  hide every odd-numbered link in the menu.
- Change every instance of the word "bacon" on the page to be "LASER VISION"
- Delete the last two posts in the middle section (they have a CSS class "post")
- Remove the images in the right column
  - Note: this change should not change the 3 column layout of the page.
